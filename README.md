# ML model for prediction of COVID-19 cases

This project employs machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The models should be able to predict positive COVID-19 cases using symptoms.

## Data

A csv file with columns of symptoms and COVID-19 status is used to train the model. The COVID-19 status column is the target and the symptom columns are the features.

## Training

Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms are used to train the predictive model on the dataset. The models are then saved as pickle files and can be used for predictions

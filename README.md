# ML model for prediction of COVID-19 cases

Machine learning models are built to predict positive COVID-19 cases from patient symptoms. The performance of the models on a relatively smaller dataset demonstrated merit in building a mobile application that could aid in rapid diagnoses and tracking of positive COVID-19 cases.

## Data

A CSV file retrieved from Kaggle is used to train the model.
Features:
* age
* fever
* cough
* runny nose
* pneumonia
* lung infection
* travel history
* **test results**

## Training
### Models
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* K Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Classifier

## Results
* Logistic Regression was the best-performing model with an accuracy score of 91%
